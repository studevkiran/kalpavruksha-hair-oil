# üîß Cashfree Credentials Verification Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Are Your Credentials for SANDBOX or PRODUCTION?

The error "endpoint or method is not valid" usually means:
**Your App ID and Secret Key don't match the environment you're trying to use.**

---

## ‚úÖ How to Verify:

### Step 1: Check Your Cashfree Dashboard

1. **Login to Cashfree:**
   - SANDBOX: https://sandbox.cashfree.com/merchant/login
   - PRODUCTION: https://merchant.cashfree.com/auth/login

2. **Go to Developers ‚Üí API Keys**

3. **Check which credentials you're using:**

   **SANDBOX Credentials:**
   - App ID starts with: `TEST...` or specific to sandbox
   - Secret Key: Specific to sandbox
   - Used for: Testing with test cards

   **PRODUCTION Credentials:**
   - App ID: Different format
   - Secret Key: Different from sandbox
   - Used for: Real payments

## üéØ What You Need to Do:

### If Using SANDBOX (Current Setup):

1. **Get SANDBOX Credentials:**
   - Go to: https://sandbox.cashfree.com/merchant/login
   - Navigate to: Developers ‚Üí API Keys
   - Copy: **Sandbox App ID** and **Sandbox Secret Key**

2. **Update Vercel Environment Variables:**
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/kirans-projects-cb89f9d8/kalpavruksha-hair-oil/settings/environment-variables
   
   **Make sure these are SANDBOX credentials:**
   - `CASHFREE_APP_ID` = Your **Sandbox App ID**
   - `CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY` = Your **Sandbox Secret Key**
   - `CASHFREE_ENV` = `SANDBOX` ‚úÖ (Already set)

3. **Redeploy after updating**

---

## üîç How to Tell if Credentials Don't Match:

### Symptom:
- `CASHFREE_ENV=SANDBOX` 
- But using **Production** App ID/Secret Key
- Result: ‚ùå "endpoint or method is not valid"

### Solution:
- Use **Sandbox** credentials with `CASHFREE_ENV=SANDBOX`
- OR
- Use **Production** credentials with `CASHFREE_ENV=PRODUCTION`

**They must match!**

## üí° Common Mistakes:

   - ‚ùå Getting credentials from Production dashboard
   - ‚úÖ Get from Sandbox dashboard for testing

2. **Mixed Credentials:**
   - ‚ùå Sandbox App ID + Production Secret Key
   - ‚úÖ Both from same environment

3. **Old Credentials:**
   - ‚ùå Using expired or regenerated keys
   - ‚úÖ Get fresh credentials from dashboard

## üÜò Still Not Working?

### Check Vercel Function Logs:
https://vercel.com/kirans-projects-cb89f9d8/kalpavruksha-hair-oil/observability/vercel-functions

Look for the actual error message from Cashfree API.

### Test Credentials Manually:
```bash
curl -X GET "https://sandbox.cashfree.com/pg/orders?limit=10" \
  -H "x-client-id: YOUR_SANDBOX_APP_ID" \
  -H "x-client-secret: YOUR_SANDBOX_SECRET_KEY" \
  -H "x-api-version: 2023-08-01"
```

If this returns an error, your credentials are wrong.
If it returns orders (or empty array), credentials are correct.
