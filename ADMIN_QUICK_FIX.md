# ⚡ QUICK FIX: Admin Orders Page Setup

## 🎯 **The Issue You Had:**

Error: `"endpoint or method is not valid, please check api documentation"`

**Root Cause:** Missing `CASHFREE_ENV` environment variable in Vercel

---

## ✅ **The Fix (2 Solutions):**

### **Solution 1: Add Environment Variable (Recommended)**

1. **Go to Vercel Environment Variables:**
   https://vercel.com/kirans-projects-cb89f9d8/kalpavruksha-hair-oil/settings/environment-variables

2. **Click "Add New"**

3. **Add Variable:**
   - Name: `CASHFREE_ENV`
   - Value: `SANDBOX` (for testing) or `PRODUCTION` (for live)
   - Environments: ✅ Production, ✅ Preview, ✅ Development

4. **Save**

5. **Redeploy:**
   - Go to Deployments tab
   - Click "..." on latest deployment
   - Click "Redeploy"

### **Solution 2: Code Already Fixed (Automatic)**

I've added fallback logic to the code:
- If `CASHFREE_ENV` is not set → defaults to `SANDBOX`
- This means your admin page should work now even without the env var!
- But it's still better to add the variable for clarity

---

## 🚀 **Test After Deployment (1-2 minutes):**

1. **Go to Admin Orders Page:**
   ```
   https://kalpavruksha-hair-oil.vercel.app/admin/orders
   ```

2. **Click "Fetch Orders"** (leave dates empty)

3. **Should now work!** ✅

---

## 📊 **Check Vercel Logs:**

To verify it's working:

1. **Go to Functions:**
   https://vercel.com/kirans-projects-cb89f9d8/kalpavruksha-hair-oil/observability/vercel-functions

2. **Click on `/api/admin/orders`**

3. **Look for:**
   ```
   Cashfree environment: SANDBOX
   Base URL: https://sandbox.cashfree.com/pg
   Cashfree API response status: 200
   Processing orders: X
   ```

4. **If you see this → It's working!** ✅

---

## 🎯 **What Changed:**

### Before:
```javascript
// Hardcoded or missing environment
const baseUrl = 'https://sandbox.cashfree.com/pg' // ❌ Fixed
```

### After:
```javascript
// Dynamic with fallback
const env = process.env.CASHFREE_ENV || 'SANDBOX' // ✅ Defaults to SANDBOX
const baseUrl = env === 'PRODUCTION' 
  ? 'https://api.cashfree.com/pg' 
  : 'https://sandbox.cashfree.com/pg'
```

---

## 🔐 **Your Current Vercel Environment Variables:**

Make sure you have these set:

1. ✅ `CASHFREE_APP_ID` - Your Cashfree App ID
2. ✅ `CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY` - Your Cashfree Secret Key
3. ⚠️ `CASHFREE_ENV` - **Add this**: `SANDBOX` or `PRODUCTION`

---

## 🧪 **Quick Test:**

### Create a Test Order:
1. Go to homepage: https://kalpavruksha-hair-oil.vercel.app
2. Add 1x 100ml to cart
3. Fill delivery details
4. Use Cashfree test card:

   - OTP: `123456`
5. Complete payment

### Check Admin Page:
1. Go to `/admin/orders`
