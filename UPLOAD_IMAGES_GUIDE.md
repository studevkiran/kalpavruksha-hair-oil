## After Uploading - Update Components

Once images are uploaded, the code will automatically use them. The components are already configured to look for:

### Logo Usage:
- **Navbar:** Uses `/images/logo.svg` (will auto-switch to logo.png if available)
- **Footer:** Uses `/images/logo.svg`

### Product Images:
Currently using placeholder images. After upload, update:

**File:** `components/ProductShowcase.tsx`
```tsx
// Change from placeholder to:
<Image 
  src="/images/product-100ml.jpg"  // Your actual image
  alt="Kalpavruksha Hair Oil 100ml"
  width={400}
  height={400}
  className="object-contain"
/>
```

## Image Optimization Tips

1. **Compress images** before uploading (use tinypng.com or similar)
2. **Use WebP format** for better performance (optional)
3. **Keep file sizes under 500KB** for faster loading
4. **Use descriptive names** like `product-200ml.jpg` instead of `IMG_1234.jpg`
