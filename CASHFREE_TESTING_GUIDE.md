- **Wallets**: Select test wallet options

## Expected Behavior

### After Successful Payment:
- Cart will be cleared automatically
- Success message: "Payment successful! Thank you for your order. üéâ"
- Order status in database: `paid`

### After Failed Payment:
- Cart remains intact
- Alert: "Payment failed. Please try again."
- Order status in database: `failed`

## Cashfree Dashboard

Monitor all test transactions:
1. Login to [Cashfree Merchant Dashboard](https://merchant.cashfree.com/)
2. Use your merchant credentials
3. Go to **Transactions** section
4. View all test orders and payments

## Going Live (When Ready)

To switch to PRODUCTION mode:

1. **Get Live Credentials**:
   - Login to Cashfree Dashboard
   - Complete KYC verification
   - Get Production App ID and Secret Key

2. **Update Environment Variables** (`.env`):
   ```bash
   CASHFREE_APP_ID=your_live_app_id
   CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY=your_live_secret_key
   ```

3. **Update Code** (`app/api/checkout/route.ts`):
   ```typescript
   const cashfree = new Cashfree(
     CFEnvironment.PRODUCTION, // Changed from SANDBOX
     process.env.CASHFREE_APP_ID!,
     process.env.CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY!
   )
   ```

4. **Update Frontend** (`components/CartDrawer.tsx`):
   ```javascript
   const cashfree = await window.Cashfree({
     mode: 'production' // Changed from 'sandbox'
   })
   ```

5. **Deploy to Vercel** with production environment variables

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Failed to create order"
- **Check**: `.env` file has correct credentials
- **Check**: Internet connection active
- **Solution**: Restart dev server after changing `.env`

### Issue: Checkout page doesn't load
- **Check**: Cashfree SDK loaded in browser (check browser console)
- **Check**: No browser extensions blocking scripts
- **Solution**: Clear cache and reload

### Issue: Payment shows as "pending" forever
- **Cause**: Using test cards that simulate pending status
- **Solution**: Use success test card `4111 1111 1111 1111`
